Pharmacologic inhibitors of HSP90 have been observed to exert a wide range of effects on the proteome, including depletion of client proteins, induction of heat shock proteins, dissociation of co-chaperones from HSP90, disruption of client protein signaling networks, and recruitment of the protein ubiquitylation and degradation machinery—suggesting widespread remodeling of cellular protein complexes. However, proteomics studies to date have focused on inhibitor-induced changes in total protein levels, often overlooking protein complex alterations. Here, we use size-exclusion chromatography in combination with mass spectrometry (SEC-MS) to characterize the early changes in native protein complexes following treatment with the HSP90 inhibitor tanespimycin (17-AAG) for 8 hours in the HT29 colon adenocarcinoma cell line. After confirming the signature cellular response to HSP90 inhibition (e.g., induction of heat shock proteins, decreased total levels of client proteins), we were surprised to find only modest perturbations to the global distribution of protein elution profiles in inhibitor-treated HT29 cells at this relatively early time-point. Similarly, co-chaperones that co-eluted with HSP90 displayed no clear difference between control and treated conditions. However, two distinct analysis strategies identified multiple inhibitor-induced changes, including known and unknown components of the HSP90-dependent proteome. We validate two of these---the actin-binding protein Anillin, and the mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3) complex---as novel HSP90 inhibitor--modulated proteins. We present this dataset as a resource for the HSP90, proteostasis, and cancer communities (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/shiny/HSP90/SEC-MS/), laying the groundwork for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies related to HSP90 pharmacology.

Healthy proteostasis relies on tightly-regulated intracellular quality control circuits that co-ordinate clearance of potentially toxic misfolded proteins arising from various internal or external stresses throughout an organism’s lifespan. Proteostasis imbalances are mechanistically linked to a broad range of ageing-associated diseases, and are also characteristic of cellular senescence—a permanent cell cycle arrest that prevents uncontrolled proliferation during development, injury repair, and tumorigenesis, but drives ageing-associated frailty, degeneration, and therapy resistance. Across a range of replicative and stress-induced senescence models in primary human cells, we have discovered differences in how misfolded proteins are triaged when compared with proliferating, quiescent, or immortalised cells---especially at the level of ubiquitin-mediated protein clearance systems. Given recent findings that proteostasis modulators act as senolytics with geroprotective properties, our work highlights the need for an improved fundamental understanding of how different ageing hallmarks are inter-connected in order to drive advances in human healthspan.","tags":["Talks","Conference Abstracts","Proteostasis","Senescence","Ageing"],"title":"Interplay between loss of proteostasis and cellular senescence: A spotlight on misfolded protein quality control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yasmeen Al-Mufti","Stephen Cranwell","Rahul S.

The size and complexity of an organism's proteostasis network positively correlate with the life span and health span. Its dysregulation is widely accepted as a primary driver of cellular and organismal aging. Furthermore, a broad range of age-associated pathologies, including neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, display characteristic rewiring of the proteostatic circuitry. In this chapter, we summarize the current state of research on how the proteostasis network is dysregulated during normal aging, mechanisms proposed for how this dysregulation drives aging-related frailty and disease, and potential interventions that hold promise for restoring proteostasis balance to maintain lifelong health.","tags":["Book Chapters","Proteostasis","Ageing"],"title":"Dysregulated proteostasis: mechanisms and links to aging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Harvey E.

A current gold standard is single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3), in which organic solvent and magnetic beads are used to denature and capture protein aggregates, with subsequent washes removing contaminants. However, SP3 is dependent on effective protein immobilization onto beads, risks losses during wash steps, and exhibits losses and greater costs at higher protein inputs. Here, we propose solvent precipitation SP3 (SP4) as an alternative to SP3 protein cleanup, capturing acetonitrile-induced protein aggregates by brief centrifugation rather than magnetism---with optional low-cost inert glass beads to simplify handling. SP4 recovered equivalent or greater protein yields for 1--5000 μg preparations and improved reproducibility (median protein *R*2 0.99 (SP4) *vs.* 0.97 (SP3)). Deep proteome profiling revealed that SP4 yielded a greater recovery of low-solubility and transmembrane proteins than SP3, benefits to aggregating protein using 80 *vs.* 50\\% organic solvent, and equivalent recovery by SP4 and S-Trap. SP4 was verified in three other labs across eight sample types and five lysis buffers---all confirming equivalent or improved proteome characterization *vs.* SP3. With near-identical recovery, this work further illustrates protein precipitation as the primary mechanism of SP3 protein cleanup and identifies that magnetic capture risks losses, especially at higher protein concentrations and among more hydrophobic proteins. SP4 offers a minimalistic approach to protein cleanup that provides cost-effective input scalability, the option to omit beads entirely, and suggests important considerations for SP3 applications─all while retaining the speed and compatibility of SP3.","tags":["Proteomics"],"title":"Solvent Precipitation SP3 (SP4) Enhances Recovery for Proteomics Sample Preparation without Magnetic Beads","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congrats to Harvey E.

Although all cells possess multiple, well-characterised protein quality control systems to mitigate the toxicity of misfolded proteins, how they are integrated to maintain protein homeostasis ('proteostasis') in health-and how their disintegration contributes to disease-is still an exciting and fast-paced area of research. Under physiological conditions, the predominant route for misfolded protein clearance involves ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation. When the capacity of this route is overwhelmed-as happens during conditions of acute environmental stress, or chronic ageing-related decline-alternative routes for protein quality control are activated. In this review, we summarise our current understanding of how proteasome-targeted misfolded proteins are retrafficked to alternative protein quality control routes such as juxta-nuclear sequestration and selective autophagy when the ubiquitin-proteasome system is compromised. We also discuss the molecular determinants of these alternative protein quality control systems, attempt to clarify distinctions between various cytoplasmic spatial quality control inclusion bodies (e.g., Q-bodies, p62 bodies, JUNQ, aggresomes, and aggresome-like induced structures 'ALIS'), and speculate on emerging concepts in the field that we hope will spur future research-with the potential to benefit the rational development of healthy ageing strategies.","tags":["Proteostasis","Review Articles"],"title":"Alternative systems for misfolded protein clearance: life beyond the proteasome","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://samantlab.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://samantlab.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://samantlab.github.io/tour/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"widget_page"}]
