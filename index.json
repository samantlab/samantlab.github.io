Following a short postdoc carrying on this work alongside an industrial drug-discovery collaboration with Merck-Serono, I moved to California in 2014 to start a postdoc in Judith Frydman’s lab (Stanford University). Here, I used the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) to expand understanding of the molecular circuits involved in misfolded protein clearance, and how these vary depending on their sub-cellular localisation.\nI started as a Tenure-track Group Leader at Babraham Institute in 2019. Our group uses a combination of mass spectrometry–based proteomics, live-cell imaging, and bespoke biochemical tools, to tease apart how communication between protein clearance systems contribute to healthy proteostasis, and how this goes awry during ageing and associated stresses.
